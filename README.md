# Log Analyzer

This is a simple Python project that generates server log files and analyzes them.
I created this project to practice file handling, regex, and basic data processing.

## Features
- Generates fake log data using Faker
- Counts total, error, and warning logs
- Extracts unique IP addresses
- Matches IPs with HTTP error codes using regex
